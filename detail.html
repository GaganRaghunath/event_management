Mission
The mission of St. Vincent Pallotti College is to provide a socially conductive environment for a harmonious growth of an
 individual who will live from moment to moment joyfully aware of his/her own specific individuality
  and with an admiration for the differences in others. The student would be introduced to a multi-
  cultural milieu in which he/she would be assisted to academic success, personal growth, responsibility
   to the societal needs, patriotism and a sense of global belonging. In a natural rustic setting away from
    the hustle and bustle of a choking city life, the students are introduced into a family of trust and love
     where individuals grow with a life long appreciation of learning and an awareness of the awesomeness of God's providence.
